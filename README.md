# Flash Chat ⚡️

## Goal

- The objective is to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I'll be using Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip the app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. 
- Build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
